        "text": "After just four months at Little Seedlings, my 5-year-old could already speak English fluently in almost every context. Beyond English, we saw our stepson grow out of his toddler habits and embrace boyhood with many new virtues. The teachers handled his hyperactivity with such love and care. We never felt guilty about his behavior, only more dedicated to helping him improve. There are no words to express our gratitude.",

She made many friends, the teachers were very helpful and kind — also helping her with reading and prepping for school. The children get meals and a lot of outside playtime, which is wonderful.",

The owners, Mari and Willem, created the atmosphere of a warm, welcoming home rather than a formal educational establishment. Our kid was truly happy there. He showed huge progress in English, math and reading. The Montessori method of learning through play worked perfectly for him.",

Mari, the director, is wonderful and provides excellent feedback along the way to make sure everyone's needs are met.",
